## ðŸš€ Mastering Customer Insights with Deep Learning! ðŸ”¥

## ðŸ’¡ Project Title:
Customer Purchase Prediction using Artificial Neural Network (ANN)

âœ¨ Recently, I worked on a hands-on deep learning project where I developed a powerful classification model to predict customer purchasing behavior. Leveraging a dataset containing customer buying information, I designed and implemented an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) with 2 hidden layers to uncover hidden patterns in customer habits and preferences.

## ðŸ“Š Key Highlights of the Project:
ðŸ”§ Built a deep learning model from scratch using ANN architecture.
ðŸ§  Designed with 2 hidden layers for effective feature learning and capturing complex relationships.
ðŸ“ˆ Trained the model on real-world customer purchase data.
ðŸŽ¯ Objective: Classify and predict whether a customer is likely to make a purchase or not based on their profile and historical behavior.
ðŸ’» Applied data preprocessing, normalization, and hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance.
âœ… Achieved high accuracy in predicting customer buying intent â€” making it a potential tool for businesses to personalize marketing strategies and boost sales conversion.

## ðŸ“š Tech Stack Used:
Python | TensorFlow / Keras | NumPy | Pandas | Scikit-learn | Matplotlib | Seaborn


## ðŸŒŸ Outcome:
The project demonstrates how deep learning can transform raw customer data into actionable business insights, enabling data-driven decision-making and targeted customer engagement.
